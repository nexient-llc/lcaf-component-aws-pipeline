## Introduction
The general pattern of how this is intended to work is:

Pipeline Service --> pipeline-seed.yml --> `specs` service-platform.yml --> `spec-scripts` service-platform.sh --> `global` functions.sh --> `local` functions.sh

Example:
1. #### Pipeline Service
   - AWS Codebuild requires a git repository that it is associated with to have a pipeline yaml file in the repo that the deployed instance of AWS codebuild is configured to parse when a build starts.
   - Since this pipeline yaml file has to exist before any automation runs, it must be committed to the repo.
2. #### pipeline-seed.yml
   - This initial pipeline yaml is called pipeline-seed.yml, which is what boot straps the pipeline to pull in all the dynamically sourced pipeline yaml and scripts.
   - The job this initial pipeline-seed.yml will perform is to run `make configure` which pulls all the dso platform dependencies into the pipeline workspace.
     - Once this make task completes any needed artifacts such as pipeline yaml, scripts, other needed artifacts, and additional make task will now be available for the pipeline to use.
   - Next, this pipeline yaml will call the context specific pipeline yaml file that was just downloaded, and the pipeline will run from there. 
3. #### specs and spec-scripts
   - Live at `linkfiles/pipeline_providers/{cloud}/{pipeline-to-cloud}/{pipeline-stage-resource}/{common or specific technology}/{sub catagory}/specs/{actions or events}/{common or specific}/{some task}.yml`
   - As each git repository intended to be managed by the Launch DSO Platform exist as a poly repo where it is expected to only produce a single environment agnostic artifact, this artifact if more than a library will be intended to deploy to a specific hosting platform.
     - For the purpose of this example let's assume that platform is an AWS ECS Cluster.
       - Pipeline stages will be triggered by 1 of 2 different scenarios:
         1. Scenario 1 is an event such as a git webhook or cloudtrail event for example.
            - This would be something like a push, pull request, or merge event.
            - In this example the pipeline yaml to handle a pull request would have a common need to simulate a merge.
            - #### specs
              - This pipeline yaml would be located in this component repo's dir tree at:
              - `linkfiles/pipeline_providers/aws/aws_pipeline-to-aws_cloud/codebuild/common/specs/actions/pipeline/simulated-merge.yml`
            - #### spec-scripts
               - The 1 to 1 mapped action script this yaml will call would be located in this component repo's dir tree at:
                 -  `linkfiles/pipeline_providers/aws/aws_pipeline-to-aws_cloud/codebuild/common/scripts/spec-scripts/actions/pipeline/simulated-merge.sh`
            - #### specs       
               - If an ECS deploy was happening the pipeline yaml would be located in this component repo's dir tree at:
                 - `linkfiles/pipeline_providers/aws/aws_pipeline-to-aws_cloud/codebuild/service-platforms/ecs-platform/specs/actions/common/deploy-artifact.yml`
            - #### spec-scripts
              - The 1 to 1 mapped action script this yaml will call would be located in this component repo's dir tree at:
                - `linkfiles/pipeline_providers/aws/aws_pipeline-to-aws_cloud/codebuild/service-platforms/ecs-platform/specs/actions/common/deploy-artifact.yml`
         2. Scenario 2 is most likely either a stage was triggered by another stage or a human.
            - For example after a merge, there would be a stage to build an artifact.
4. #### global `functions.sh`
5. #### local `functions.sh`

## General Pipeline Requirements
1. All git repositories which will be managed by a pipeline must contain a seed pipeline yaml file
     - this seed pipeline file's only purpose is to install the dso platform by running a `make configure`, and
     - call the intended pipeline yaml file that was just pulled down dynamically.
     - this seed pipeline file is the entry point to integration with this dso platform pipeline code
2. Pipelines with stages must be used.
     - for example in AWS a Pipeline resource cannot be called with arguments, thus AWS Codebuild is called first
       which accepts ARGS and it is used to trigger a Pipeline, where that Pipeline's configuration was defined at the
       time of its creation by Terraform
3. All pipeline yaml and the shell scripts that they call must be client and application agnostic.
4. When a pipeline yaml file requires the use of scripts as opposed to native yaml functions:
   
     - these yaml files should only call 1 shell script with arguments,
   
     - where these arguments are populated by global environment variables that are either supplied,
   
       - directly by the configuration of the pipeline, or
   
       - shell script above that call of the script that derives the needed values and sets that as global
         environment variables.
5. The intent of this project is to keep libraries of pipeline yaml and shell logic structured, organize, dry, and
composable.
   
    - In the current directory and file structure there are examples of will be real world implementations of shell script 
      that is organized.
    - Any additional of native yaml functions is required to all be structured and organized following the current
      patterns
6. All functions with the directory `local` in the tree are only permitted to use local scoped variables which in bash
can only be set inside of functions.
   - the only files containing functions that may exist must be named `functions.sh` and nested in a meaningful directory
     path following the current pattern
   - no script inside of `functions.sh` files may contain logic outside a function except for: `set -ex` 
   - a `function.sh` file inside a directory where that same directory contains other directories is implied to be
     common to its parent directory
     - a `function.sh` file in a nested directory related to a technology group or tool is to be scoped to its nearest
       parent directory
7. Global function files, in-line script within pipeline yaml files, or Spec Scripts where Spec Scripts provide a script
   called by a pipeline yaml file are the only place where global environment variables may be used or created.
